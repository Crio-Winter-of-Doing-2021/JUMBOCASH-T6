## Where it lags

1. DB lookups are not optimized
   1. On every authorized request app calls DB twice
   2. Join the entity name in transaction
   3. Indexing is not done
2. Refactoring the codebase
3. Report are generated every time, from Database
4. Implement Cache
5. Cors - deal with cross domain cookie issue, configure origin
6. Configuring nginx to serve static files, ssl encryption
7. Configuring nginx as a load balancer.
8. Migrating to https
9. Make a build and deploy pipeline
10. How to store data in database, should we clean old data, when does data becomes old and some more questions ?


## Challenges faced

1. Time format conflict - what format of time will be used
1. Migrated api from heroku to aws.(Since heroku went down for a couple of hours, which was a critical stage for our development)
1. Implementation Oauth2.0 authentication, passport documentation is not enough
1. Cors: current issue
2. Removing authentication with minimal change in code base.
3. Providing a test user id, so that other user's data is not compromised.
